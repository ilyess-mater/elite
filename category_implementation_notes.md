# Category Implementation Notes

## Implemented Features

1. **Backend API for Categories**
   - Created a new `category_routes.py` file with endpoints for:
     - Getting all categories for a user
     - Creating a new category
     - Updating an existing category
     - Deleting a category
     - Setting a category for a contact
     - Setting a category for a group

2. **Frontend Category Management**
   - Created a `CategoryManager.js` component for managing categories
   - Added CSS styles in `category-manager.css`
   - Updated `MessagingPage.js` to:
     - Fetch and display categories
     - Filter contacts by category
     - Assign categories to contacts

   - Add UI for assigning categories to groups

2. **UI Refinements**
   - Add visual indicators for contacts/groups with categories
   - Improve mobile responsiveness of category UI
   - Add animations for category transitions

3. **Additional Features**

   - Add category statistics (number of contacts/groups per category)
   - Add category-based notifications settings

## Implementation Notes

The category system allows users to organize their conversations into custom categories with user-defined colors. This helps users manage large numbers of contacts and group chats by providing a way to filter and visually distinguish different types of conversations.

The implementation follows a clean separation of concerns:
- Backend API handles data persistence and validation
- Frontend components handle UI and user interactions
- State management is handled locally in each component

The category system is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as nested categories, shared categories, or integration with other features like search and notifications.
